# object-tracking
 
Project to use a deep learning algorithm for object detection and implement a tracking algorithm to track the object

Note: Only single object detection is performed as a PoC

Combinations of two object detection alogirithms and two tracking algorithms have been used to compare the results

Object Detection : MobileNetSSD vs YOLOv3 <br />
Tracking         : dlib correlation tracker vs kalman filter

#### Trials performed:
1. MobileNetSSD +  dlib correlation tracker
2. YOLOv3 + dlib correlation tracker
3. YOLOv3 + dlib correlation tracker vs kalman filter
